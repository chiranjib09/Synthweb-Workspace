Q-  WHAT IS OPERATORS IN JS ?

   -> In JavaScript, an operator is a symbol that performs an operation on one or more operands, such as variables or values, and returns a result. Let us take a simple expression 4 + 5 is equal to 9. Here 4 and 5 are called operands, and ‘+’ is called the operator.

      -  Arithmetic Operators
      -  Comparison Operators
      -  Logical (or Relational) Operators
      -  Bitwise Operators
