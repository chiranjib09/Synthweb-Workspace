//Assignment operators in JavaScript are used to assign values to variables. The most common assignment operator is the simple assignment (=), but there are several compound assignment operators that combine an arithmetic operation with assignment.

const obj = {};
obj.x = 3;
console.log(obj.x);
console.log(obj);

const key = "y";
obj[key] = 5;
console.log(obj[key]);
console.log(obj);
