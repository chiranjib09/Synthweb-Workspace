//An anonymous function is simply a function that does not have a name. Unlike named functions, which are declared with a name for easy reference, anonymous functions are usually created for specific tasks and are often assigned to variables or used as arguments for other functions.

let sum = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

console.log(sum(5, 3));
