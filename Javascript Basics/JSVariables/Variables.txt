VARIABLES IN JavaScript


-> JavaScript variables are used to store data that can be changed later on.
   These variables can be thought of as named containers.
   You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container.

   In JavaScript, you can declare the variables in 4 ways âˆ’
    - Without using any keywords.
    - Using the 'var' keyword.
    - Using the 'let' keyword.
    - Using the 'const' keyword.

   The let and const keywords were introduced to JavaScript in 2015 (ES6). Prior to ES6, only var keyword was used to declare the variable in JavaScript.
